Semetic search engine
1. Vector Database: You will need to choose a vector database like Pinecone to store the text that will be searched. The vector database will be used to store and index the text documents.

2. Vectorization Algorithm: You will need to implement a vectorization algorithm that encodes the text documents into a vector representation. You can use Open AIâ€™s latest text embeddings to vectorize the search query and the text documents to be searched from.

3. Similarity Search Algorithm: You will need to implement a similarity search algorithm that can find the most similar documents to the user's query. The algorithm should be optimized for speed and accuracy.

4. User Interface: You will need to develop a user interface that allows users to enter their queries and view the search results. The interface should be intuitive and easy to use. You're welcome to use a UI template if that is easier.
5. ### Optional Components

- [x] **Multi-lingual Support**: The search engine could support multiple languages, allowing users to search for documents in different languages.
- [x] **Synonym Expansion**: The search engine could include a synonym expansion feature that expands the user's query to include similar words and phrases.
- [x] **Document Ranking**: The search engine could rank the search results based on their relevance to the user's query.
- [x] **Entity Extraction**: The search engine could include an entity extraction feature that identifies and extracts entities like people, places, and organizations from the search results.
- [ ] **Integration with Third-Party Services**: The search engine could be integrated with third-party services like Google Drive or Dropbox to provide a more comprehensive search experience.
- [ ] **Customizable Search Index**: The search engine could allow users to choose what text they want to be searched from and create a customized search index.
