# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

General Overview:

The aim of this project is to implement a semantic search using artificial intelligence. A search engine that encodes the user's query into a vector and searches for similarity within a body of text. The user can store all the text to be searched using a vector database like Pinecone. This search engine will be designed to provide accurate and relevant search results.

## Features of The search engine.
1. Vector Database: A vector database like Pinecone to store the text that will be searched. The vector database will be used to store and index the text documents.

2. Vectorization Algorithm:  Implement a vectorization algorithm that encodes the text documents into a vector representation. Open AIâ€™s latest text embeddings to vectorize the search query and the text documents to be searched from.

3. Similarity Search Algorithm: Implement a similarity search algorithm that can find the most similar documents to the user's query. The algorithm should be optimized for speed and accuracy.

4. User Interface: Develop a user interface that allows users to enter their queries and view the search results. The interface should be intuitive and easy to use.

### Additional Features.

- [x] **Multi-lingual Support**: The search engine could support multiple languages, allowing users to search for documents in different languages.
- [x] **Synonym Expansion**: The search engine could include a synonym expansion feature that expands the user's query to include similar words and phrases.
- [x] **Document Ranking**: The search engine could rank the search results based on their relevance to the user's query.
- [x] **Entity Extraction**: The search engine could include an entity extraction feature that identifies and extracts entities like people, places, and organizations from the search results.
